Simple AIMD:

We incremented the cwnd by 1/cwnd on each ack, and added a function that 
informs the controller when a timeout occured, setting cwnd to k * cwnd, where
c < 1. The initial cwnd size was 1.

We tested many different values of c, but even setting cwnd to 1 after each
timeout, but had poor results since the buffer size is unbounded.

In an attempt to improve performance, we tested adding an upper bound on the
cwnd, never allowing it to increase past 20, and setting the cwnd to 1 whenever
we would normally increment past 20 (emulating a sawtooth-AIMD type behavior).

We additionally tried tweaking the timeout value from the initial value of
1000ms. By setting the timeout to 50ms, we observed a power score of 16, our
best so far (with no upper bound on cwnd.)

AIMD is not performing very well, failing to get a power score above about 12.
We suspect this is because the
