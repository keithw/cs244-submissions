Exercise 2

We implemented an AIMD scheme that increased by the inverse of the window size
every time an ack was received and decreased by a factor of 2 when the time
between sending and receiving the datagram was more than 200ms. We chose 200ms
because the average RTT appeared to be around 100ms. Timeouts posed an
interesting problem because if you see one timeout you're likely to see a few in
a row. We tried both decreasing whenever there was a timeout and only decreasing
once per timeout batch. Decreasing every time led to significantly better signal
delay.
